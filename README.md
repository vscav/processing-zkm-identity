# ZKM logo proposal
> On the basis of generative and algorithmic aesthetics, and by being attentive to color systems (Johanes Iten, Joseph Albers), we think, create, program and generate a new design for the logo of the exhibition *Writting the History of the Future* from the *ZKM* (Zentrum f√ºr Kunst und Medien) cultural institution.
