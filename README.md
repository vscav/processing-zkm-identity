# logo_ZKM_processing
> On the basis of generative and algorithmic aesthetics, and by being attentive to color systems (Johanes Iten, Joseph Albers), we think, create, program and generate a new design for the logo of the exhibition 'Writting the History of the Future' from ZKM cultural institution.

## How to use
1. Install Processing software 
2. Open `logo_ZKM_processing.pde` with your Processing editor
3. When playing the logo, press space bar in order to save the logo in the logos folder of the project

## Intention
This logo could symbolize sharing, evolution and equality between organic world and digital one. The purpose of our work is to show the power of transversality between these two worlds.
